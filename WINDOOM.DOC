i. Foreword - What's new with this version?

1.  Fixed bug that kept left alt key from working.

2.  Fixed "exit crash" bug.

3.  Various memory leaks plugged.

4.  Changed bind command to allow for key scancode entry.  This was
    done solely to allow for foreign keyboard (or Dvorak) owners to
    customize their controls.  You still can't change the weapons
    keys nor can you change the console or menu keys.

NOTE: I cannot stress enough that you MUST have DirectX 5 installed
      and working on your machine for this program to work.  If you
      don't have DirectX 5, IT WILL NOT WORK. And no amount of com-
      plaining to me about it will change that.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is WinDoom?

Thanks go first to id Software for making a great game then releasing
the source code to it so we could have something else to play with.

I have changed no gameplay at all.  You CAN use some new cheat codes
in the console but about all you can do now is get the backpack you
couldn't get by cheating before.

WinDoom is my version (so far) of a Win32 port of the Linux Doom
source code released by id Software.  I have gotten most of the
features of the original program working but it isn't quite finished
yet.  It does odd things occasionally.

Please DO E-Mail me with problems you've had with this especially if
you can't get it working at all. I already know of most of the
problems you may encounter and I am already addressing them.  But I
want feedback about any problems you encounter.  There is a file
generated in your game directory called windoom.dbg.  It contains
some data that will probably be helpful to me in debugging whatever
problem you've encountered. Screenshots may be helpful, too.

I have several very different systems to test this on and a LAN as
well but I couldn't possibly duplicate the variety of systems you
all have. Running it on your systems is the best testing I can get.

I know this is more like a public Beta test but I did want to share
what I have done so far, though.

Also, please don't send me E-Mails asking for features or changes.
There will be time enough for that after the game actually works
properly. Please don't ask me to fix bugs in the original game. I'm
just trying to make sure that changes I've made haven't introduced
new bugs.

New revisions will be forthcoming soon.

Also, when I've got all the original Doom features working and the
program stabilized, I will release my source code for the program.

To anyone working on their own Win32 ports of Doom: If you want to
share programming information then all you have to do is ask. I'll
tell you whatever I know if it will help.  I AM going to release my
modified source code when I get this stabilized.

A few new things have been added along the way.

1. A print screen key is now always available by pressing
   the (Print Screen/Sys Rq) key on your keyboard.  If you
   aren't playing a game, no message will appear on the
   screen but a print screen PCX file WILL be generated.

2. I have added a console similar to the Quake/Quake II
   console.  It isn't as fancy and no doubt not as functional
   as the Quake console but it works and any keyboard command
   such as the cheats can be entered in the console.  Also,
   all messages that appear on the screen briefly will be
   displayed in the console.  The console key is the "`"
   key.

3. As you see above, a CD player is now supported.  A number
   of features are planned for this (playlists, directory,
   naming, song naming, etc.)  Trying to play a CD with no
   CD in the drive will do nothing.  Removing the CD from the
   drive while playing will result in the MIDI song being
   restarted.  The CD player will detect if the CD has been
   changed and start playing on the first music track (if
   there is one) and will not play if there are no music
   tracks.

4. Midi file playing. Currently a single MIDI file will be played
   (if it exists) in the game directory. The name of this file is
   doomsong.mid.  It can be any valid MIDI file.  It will be played
   ALL the time unless you turn on the CD player.

5. There is now an "always_run" key. I got this idea from Chi
   Hoang and his DOSDoom. The always_run key is the <CAPS LOCK>
   key and it toggles between on and off.

6. There is an "mvert" setting and an "mvert" key to toggle it on
   and off.  It is persistent (gets saved and restored).

7. Keyboard bindings have been added.

8. Mouse and joystick bindings have been added.

9. The system uses keyboard scancodes exclusively for system
   controls.  All other values in windoom.ini are true=1 and
   false=0.  true=on, false=off

10.The ability to record, stop and play back demo from the console.
   This is currently not working properly.  You can try it but it
   probably won't work right.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Program Requirements

This program is a Win32 application and REQUIRES DirectX 5
(available for NT).  It would not have been possible to do
what was done with DirectX 3.  DirectX 5 will be supported in
the 5.0 version of NT. If you have Windows95 and you don't have
DirectX 5, you can get it here:

http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/directx5/directx5.htm

If you have NT 4.0 and want DirectX 5 you'll have to look around
for it.  It's there but I don't know a stable place you can
download it from.

If you want to run ANYTHING under Windows95 you really should
have at least 16 Meg of RAM.  32 Meg is MUCH better. NT better
have 32 to start with.

You must have a functioning TCP/IP connection to play a
network game using this program.  Internet play is not stable
at all and not recommended.

You CAN play with just the keyboard but both the mouse and
a joystick (or other game controller) are supported.

There is a way for people who use NT 4 to run this program.
There is a version of DirectX 5 for NT 5 floating around the
Internet.  I found it at www.op3dfx.com on the 15 Jan, 1998
news page. It appears to be the DirectX 5 from the NT 5 beta.
I don't know that this is supposed to be distributed but I
downloaded it and installed it on my NT 4.0 Server and it
works.

As far as I can tell, no resolutions below 640x480 are supported
by the DirectX 5 for NT drivers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Setting up WinDoom

Create a directory and put the WinDoom.exe program in it
along with the Doom IWAD of your choice  (I've tested this
with all three of the Doom I wads (doom1.wad, doom.wad and
doomu.wad) as well as doom2.wad, tnt.wad and plutonia.wad.

The order of precedence in looking for an IWAD is this:

doom2.wad    - retail Doom II wad file
plutonia.wad - Another Doom II IWAD from id
tnt.wad      - Another Doom II IWAD from id
doomu.wad    - ultimate Doom I retail wad file
doom.wad     - Doom I registered shareware wad
doom1.wad    - Doom I unregistered shareware wad

When the program is first run, it will create a section in
the win.ini file for WINDOOM that stores the location of
the WinDoom program.  If you move the program or change the
name of the directory in which the program is installed you
need to update this ini file entry or remove it.

An ini file will be created (or updated) in the directory
in which WinDoom is run with the configuration information
for the program. Modifying this file is currently the only way
to change some of the mouse/joystick mappings.

A way to change your keyboard mappings and the values for your
mouse and joystick has been added to the console in the program.

Make sure your shortcut, if you create one, has the directory
where you installed the program as the working directory.  It
probably won't run otherwise.

I have not tried some of the original command line options to see
if they work or not.  I have spent most of my time writing code
to get the program working.  I will be testing the rest of these soon.

I have tested the following and know that they work:

-nomonsters
-deathmatch
-altdeath
-net
-skill
-warp
-episode
-playdemo
-timedemo
-record
-file
-width
-height

For information on how to use the options other than -net, -width
and -height please see the official Doom FAQ.

I don't know of any others that are normally usable.


----------------------------------------------------------------

4. The console

This program does not currently support the original music from 
the game. It is stored in a format called "MUS" and is not
directly playable by the MCI midi sequencer in Windows.

In order to still have music in the game, I wrote some routines
to access and control the cd player that is found in most pc's
today.

I made a vain attempt to map the cd controls into unused keys
in the Doom keyboard but no combination I could think of made
any sense.  So I created a console where cd commands could be
entered.

While I was testing the code for controlling the cd player from
the console, I remembered what an absolute pain it was to try 
to enter cheat codes without being able to tell if the keys
were entered properly.  I decided to allow cheat code entry
into the console as well so I could see what I was typing.

I then decided to add NEW cheat codes that were similar to
the ones I had gotten used to in Quake and Quake II. It sort
of ballooned from there...

The console command key is "`".  This key both opens and closes
the console.  The menu command key <ESC> also closes the console
and starts the menu.  If the menu is up when you press the console
command key, the menu will close and the console will open.

Here is a list of the commands you can now enter on the command
line of the console:

   iddqd          - god mode
   idfa           - full ammo
   idkfa          - keys full ammo
   idclev         - change level
   idchoppers     - chainsaw and invulnerability
   idclip         - no clipping toggle
   idspispopd     - no clipping toggle
   idbeholdi      - invisibility
   idbeholdv      - invulnerability
   idbeholds      - strength (berserk pack)
   idbeholdr      - radiation/environment suit
   idbeholdl      - light amplification goggles
   idbeholda      - all map cheat
   cd on          - starts your cd player (switches from midi)
   cd off         - stops your cd player (switches to midi)
   cd pause       - pause/resume cd music toggle
   cd resume      - pause/resume cd music toggle
   cd next        - play next song on cd
   cd +           - play next song on cd
   cd prev        - play previous song on cd
   cd -           - play previous song on cd
   cd XX          - plays song number specified in XX 00 to 99
   midi pause     - pauses/resumes the midi playback (toggle)
   midi resume    - pauses/resumes the midi playback (toggle)
   quit           - quits the game (immediately)
   god            - enable god mode (degreelessness?) toggle
   map            - e?m? or map?? (Doom I or Doom II map names)
   noclip         - no clipping toggle
   give all       - gives full ammo,armor,health,weapons,keys
   give ammo      - gives full ammo
   give armor     - gives full armor
   give health    - give 100% health
   give weapons   - gives all weapons
   give keys      - gives all keys
   give backpack  - gives ammo backpack
   always_run X   - toggles always run 0 = off, 1 = on
   swap_stereo X  - toggles swap left/right 0 = off, 1 = on
   bind           - binds a value to a cvar
   record         - records a demo in new demo II format
   finish         - stops recording a demo II format demo
   play           - plays back a demo II format demo
   cmdlist        - lists console commands

   The map and idclev commands are disabled from the console
   during a network game. It crashes the machine you do it
   on and locks up the KEY player's machine.  The other players
   can exit the game but their systems are VERY slow. (You
   have to hold the keys longer.)

   All the original cheat codes work EXACTLY as they did
   originally.  No changes have been made to those. The
   new MAP command works similarly to the MAP command in
   Quake/QuakeII. If you want to select a Doom 1 or Doom
   II level you type in MAP then the full name of the
   map you want to load (E1M7 or MAP19).

   All the cheats are disabled during network games, also.
   Note: This does not include the game control commands,
   just the "cheats".

   A number of other commands are planned for this. Mostly
   just game variables that you can set. (like always_run)

   All game input is dead while the console is active, so
   be warned! The <ESCAPE> key as well as the "`" key will
   terminate the console.  Any command that you have not
   pressed <ENTER> to complete will be thrown away.  The
   menu and console shut each other down when you call
   them up.  They are mutually exclusive.


----------------------------------------------------------------

5. Changing your controls


With the "bind" command on the console, you can now change
your keyboard mappings from the console.  Additional mappings
and controls will be added later.

The bind command works backwards from the Quake bind command.
You enter the bind command, the cvar you want a keystroke bound
to followed by the key or the keyname.

Some keys are not printable and so are accessed through their
keyname.  Other keys are printable and accessed directly by
entering the actual key.

The following are the keyboard control cvars that have been
implemented so far:

key_right       - the key to turn right - also used in menu
key_left        - the key to turn left - also used in menu
key_up          - the key to move forward - also used in menu
key_down        - the key to move backward - also used in menu
key_strafeleft  - key used to slide to the left
key_straferight - key used to slide to the right
key_fire        - key used to fire weapons
key_use         - key used to open doors and flip switches
key_strafe      - toggle key used to change turn to strafe
key_speed       - key used to go faster (straight or turning)
joyb1           - joystick button 1
joyb2           - joystick button 2
joyb3           - joystick button 3
joyb4           - joystick button 4
mouseb1         - left mouse button
mouseb2         - right mouse button
mouseb3         - middle mouse button

These cvars can be set to any printable character or they
can be set to any of the following key names:

NULL        - do nothing
BACK        - back-space
ENTER       - normal enter key (may not function properly)
LCTRL       - left control key
LSHIFT      - left shift key
RSHIFT      - right shift key
LALT        - left alt key
SPACE       - space bar
CAPS        - caps lock key
NUMLOCK     - numlock lock key
SCROLL      - scroll lock key
PAD7        - 7/home key on keypad
PAD8        - 8/up arrow on keypad
PAD9        - 9/page up on keypad
PAD-        - the "-" key on keypad
PAD4        - 4/left arrow on keypad
PAD5        - 5 key on keypad
PAD6        - 6/right arrow on keypad
PAD+        - the "+" key on keypad
PAD1        - 1/end key on keypad
PAD2        - 2/down arrow on keypad
PAD3        - 3/page down on keypad
PAD0        - 0/insert on keypad
PAD.        - ./delete on keypad
PADENTER    - enter key on keypad
RCTRL       - right control key
PAD/        - the "/" key on keypad
RALT        - right alt key
HOME        - home key (grey)
UP          - up key (grey)
PAGEUP      - page up (grey)
LEFT        - left arrow (grey)
RIGHT       - right arrow (grey)
END         - end key (grey)
DOWN        - down key (grey)
PAGEDOWN    - page down (grey)
INSERT      - insert key (grey)
DELETE      - delete key (grey)

The bind command currently works backward from the bind command
in Quake.  The Quake bind command binds commands to keys.  This
bind command binds keys to commands.  A subtle but important
difference. (and one that may change)

Doom was designed with only a few customizable commands. The
rest are set and unchangable.  Quake was designed with a very
different idea about how the controls should work.

Doom may, at a later date, be converted to use the type of
command control that Quake uses.  For now I have stayed with
the original command implementation.

The commands in Doom are referred to as cvars.

The bind command syntax works like this:

BIND KEY_USE SPACE

Which will bind the space bar to the use cvar. You will get a
message if the bind command is successful telling you that the
cvar is bound to the key you specified like this:

CMD KEY_USE BOUND TO SCANCODE 57

In this case the space bar has a keyboard scan code of 57.

If the keyboard command you are trying to bind to a command
cvar does not exist, you will get this error message:

BIND ERROR: INVALID KEY VALUE

If the keyboard command cvar you are trying to bind does
not exist, you will get this error message:

BIND ERROR: INVALID CVAR

There is also another type of command you can issue at the
console which is not listed above because it is used to
set the value of some game control cvars.

Control cvars are not the same as command cvars.  Command
cvars are used to generate program input.  Control cvars
are used to control the way the program behaves.

The currently defined control cvars are:

always_run     - you always run in the game
swap_stereo    - reverses stereo sound "panning"
usemouse       - is mouse input available
mousebfire     - which mouse button is used to "fire"
mousebstrafe   - which mouse button toggles "strafe"
mousebforward  - which mouse button moves you forward
usejoystick    - is joystick input available
joybfire       - which joystick button is used to "fire"
joybstrafe     - which joystick button toggles "strafe"
joybuse        - which joystick button opens doors/flips switches
joybspeed      - which joystick button makes you run
mvert          - 0 = mouse normal, 1 = mouse left/right only

The syntax for using these controls is simple. You enter the
name of the cvar and the value you wish to assign to it like
this:

always_run 0

If the cvar is valid and the value is within the acceptable
limits, you will get a message like this:

always_run SET TO 0

If you enter an invalid cvar name, you will get this error
message:

ERROR: INVALID CVAR

If you enter a valid cvar name but enter an invalid value for
it, you will get this error message:

ERROR: INVALID VALUE

The usemouse and usejoystick cvars tell the program whether
you want to use mouse and/or joystick input if either or both
are available.

The value of 0 for either of these turns off the support for
that device.  A value of 1 turns it back on.

The button numbers for the mouse and joystick start at 0 rather
than 1. So a two button mouse has buttons 0 and 1. The left and
right mouse buttons respectively. A joystick with two buttons
also has buttons 0 and 1.  Which button is which usually depends
on the joystick but the trigger is usually button 0 while the
the other buttons are numbered starting at 1.  Some experimen-
tation may be required before you get the buttons to work the
way you expect them to.

Remember that usemouse must be set to 1 to be able to use a
mouse and usejoystick must be set to 1 to be able to use a
joystick with the program.

The functions defined in the cvars list are ALL the functions
that could ever be assigned to mouse and joystick controls in
Doom.  No other functions have ever been possible.

The changes you make to your controls with this are immediate
and persistent. (meaning that they are saved in the windoom.ini
file and are used the next time you start the WinDoom)


----------------------------------------------------------------

6. Using hi-res mode


Part of the reason for porting this code to Win32 was to be
able to use high resolution video modes.

This program supports all video 8 bit (256) color modes that are
available with the DirectDraw drivers on your computer.  Some are
not recommended.  Do NOT try to use video modes where the height
value is greater than the width value. (i.e. 320x400)  You will
NOT be happy with the result and the program will probably die.

In order to know what video modes are available to you, you can
look in the DirectX applet in your control panel or you can run
the program once and look at the contents of the windoom.dbg
file created in the directory where you installed the program.

Once you have run WinDoom a video mode list will be written to
the windoom.dbg file.  You can pick a mode from this list as
long as the height does not exceed the width and the color bits
value is 8.

I have had some machines not give a picture when running in some
of the high resolution modes even though the program was running.
I could press escape, down, enter and "y" to exit the program
but I never saw any output from the game.  I don't know what
causes this.  I am investigating it.  If you have this problem
please notify me and tell me what video setup you have.

The syntax for high the resolution modes is:

-width xxxx -height yyy

where the xxxx is the width you want to use (like 320) and the
yyy is the height you want to use (like 240).  So to start
WinDoom and run the program at 640x480 resolution, you would
put the following parameters on the command line of your WinDoom
shortcut:

-width 640 -height 480

You can access the command line for your shortcut by right
clicking the mouse on the shortcut then selecting the properties
option then clicking on the properties tab in the dialog box.


DISCLAIMER

I make absolutely NO warrantees of any kind for this
program.  I am not responsible for any consequences
of anyone using this program.

id Software owns the rights to Doom and to the source
code they distributed.  This program was compiled from
source code to that game that was modified by me. So
don't bug id Software if you've got a problem with
this program.  I'm the one who screwed up. Tell me.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Playing a network game

Okay, this is little different than a DOS Doom network game.
It's just like the Linux parameters, though.

What you want to do is create a shortcut to your game and
then change the parameters of your shortcut to include the
network commands on the command line.

The parameter to start a network game is "-net" (without the
quotes).  You then follow the -net command with the player
number your machine is going to be (1 to 4) and the IP
addresses or hostnames of the OTHER systems you will be
playing with. The IP addresses MUST be preceded by a period
".". If you leave off the leading period, the game will
think that the IP address is a hostname and try to resolve
it into an IP address (and die on you).

Sample command lines for two players would look like this:

machine 1: (hostname: rimmer IP address: 192.168.1.5)
windoom -net 1 holly -deathmatch -nomonsters
OR
windoom -net 1 .192.168.1.4 -deathmatch -nomonsters

machine 2: (hostname: holly IP address: 192.168.1.4)
windoom -net 2 rimmer -deathmatch -nomonsters
OR
windoom -net 2 .192.168.1.5 -deathmatch -nomonsters

In order to use hostnames rather than IP addresses you
must either have DNS setup or have a valid hosts file.

If you add a third or fourth machine to the game you need
to add the IP addresses of the OTHER machines to the
command line on each machine. You do not put your own
machine's IP address on the command line.  You also
do not put how many machines are in the game after the
-net command.  Only which player, out of the 4, you are.

The player numbers must be contiguous.  You can't have
players 1,2 and 4.  Also, one player MUST be player 1.
Player 1 is the KEY player and that machine coordinates
all the other systems.

The number of players in the game is determined by how
many IP addresses you put on the command line plus your
machine.

The command line on the KEY player's machine in a four
player game might look like this:

windoom -net 1 .192.168.1.3 .192.168.1.4 .192.168.1.5 -deathmatch -nomonsters
OR
windoom -net 1 cat holly rimmer -deathmatch -nomonsters

The other player's command lines in the same game might
look like this:

windoom -net 2 lister holly rimmer -deathmatch -nomonsters
OR
windoom -net 2 .192.168.1.2 .192.168.1.4 .192.168.1.5 -deathmatch -nomonsters

windoom -net 3 lister cat rimmer -deathmatch -nomonsters
OR
windoom -net 3 .192.168.1.2 .192.168.1.3 .192.168.1.5 -deathmatch -nomonsters

windoom -net 4 lister cat holly -deathmatch -nomonsters
OR
windoom -net 4 .192.168.1.2 .192.168.1.3 .192.168.1.4 -deathmatch -nomonsters

If you start a network game and the program appears to be
"hung" (black screen only), press and hold the escape
key for a few seconds.  The program will terminate. It
generates an error when shutting down but it doesn't
affect game play.  I should have that error figured out
soon.

I DO NOT know if the UDP datagrams used are robust enough
to allow this to be played over the internet.  My assumption
is that it would be but I don't know. I haven't tried it.

I have started up a four player game on my network and
played at all four stations. Response was good and play
appeared to be smooth.

I'd be interested to know if anyone is able to play this
over the Internet with all the problems that entails. I can't
because of my router.

WARNINGS!

This program is by no means ready for prime time but it does work
mostly.  The original music was a large part of Doom for some of
us and this game isn't complete without it. It IS being worked on.
It may not be possible, however, to play against other versions of
Doom with this code.  I DO have the specifications for the IPX
protocol used by the original Doom and I will attempt to make that
work as well.

Supporting DOS Doom in network games is, therefore, doubtful but
it may happen.  However if Chi and I can maintain the same message
data for the networking, you should be able to play network games
between the two.
